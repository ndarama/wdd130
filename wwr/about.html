            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010, our Rafting NOW company began with a single dream: to share the exhilaration of white-water rafting with adventure seekers from around the world. Our founder, Eric Smith, was an avid outdoor enthusiast who discovered a passion for rafting on a trip to the mighty rivers of Utah. Inspired by the thrill of navigating through rapids and the breathtaking beauty of the natural landscapes, Eric Smith decided to bring this experience to others.</p>
            <p>Starting with just a few rafts and a small team of dedicated guides, our company quickly gained a reputation for providing safe, exciting, and memorable rafting adventures. Our commitment to safety, customer satisfaction, and environmental stewardship set us apart in the industry.</p>
            <p>Over the years, we have expanded our operations to include a variety of rafting trips suitable for all skill levels, from calm family-friendly floats to adrenaline-pumping Class V rapids. We have also introduced additional adventure activities such as kayaking, canyoning, and zip-lining to provide a comprehensive outdoor experience.</p>
            <p>Our team of experienced guides and support staff has grown, each member sharing a deep love for the outdoors and a commitment to delivering the best possible adventure experience. We pride ourselves on our safety record, our knowledgeable guides, and our ability to tailor each trip to the needs and desires of our guests.</p>
            <p>Today, we are recognized as one of the leading rafting companies in the region, attracting adventure enthusiasts from around the globe. Our dedication to excellence and our passion for adventure remain at the heart of everything we do, ensuring that each trip we organize is not just a rafting excursion, but a journey into the wild that our customers will remember for a lifetime.</p>
            <p>Join us on the river and experience the thrill of white-water rafting as it was meant to beâ€”exciting, safe, and utterly unforgettable.</p>
